# Robo-help
This is a Python Flask web application that allows users to chat with different virtual assistants based on their profession. The application also includes a search feature that filters categories of professions based on user input.

The main functionality of the app is the chat feature, which is implemented using HTML templates and JavaScript to enable communication between the user and the virtual assistant. The app has two versions, one in English and the other in Hebrew, to cater to a wider audience.

The virtual assistants in the app provide profession-specific assistance by answering user queries and providing relevant information. Users can select a profession from a list of available options and start a conversation with the respective virtual assistant. The conversation history is saved, and the user can clear the conversation and start afresh.
